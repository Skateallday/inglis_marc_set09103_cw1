Bones Bearings started when George Powell saw the need of skateboarders for faster bearings in the early 80's. After searcing for a good bearing manufacturer that would still be affordable to skateboarders George found a manufacturer in Switzerland that had bearings that were faster than any that they had at the time. He worked with them to design a bearing that would be ideal for skateboarders.
