Nike Skateboarding, primarily known as Nike SB, the the Nike brand for its line of shoes, clothing and equipment for skateboarding. In 1997, Nike commenced production of its own line of skate shoe but was unable to sell to many specialist skate shops as teh market was already strongy in favour of companies such as DV, Globe, eS, Emerica and Vans. It was not until 2002 when Nike introduced the SB brand that it started to gain some traction in the sport and slowly made its mark on the sport.
