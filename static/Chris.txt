Born 19th of December, 1980, Chris Haslam is a Canadian born professional skateboarder. He is recognized as an innovative skaters whose style is defined by creativity and progression.


Around 2003 he joined Almost Skateboards along with fellow pro skaters, Song (Thrasher magazine's 2006 Skater of the Year), Mullen and Wilt. Soon after joining the new company, Haslam appeared in an "Either/Or" feature for Skateboarder magazine, in which he is photographed by the editor of the publication, Jaime Owens, from mirror-image angles while performing the same trick (the skateboarder was therefore required to perform the trick in both regular and switch stance). Haslam performed a trick called a "Salad grind" on the same handrail that was used by Guy Mariano and Jason Lee in the Blind video, Video Days.
